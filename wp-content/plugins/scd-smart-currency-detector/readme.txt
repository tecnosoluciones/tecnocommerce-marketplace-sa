**SCD named Smart Currency Detector** is a plugin that manages currency conversion in a very intelligent way.
Our plugin is built for single-vendors as well as for multi-vendors marketplaces. It supports you throughout the end 2 end currencies conversion process:

&#10031;It allows you to choose how the prices of the products will be displayed to the user who visits your site.The default configuration is according to the user's geolocation
(You can also thanks to our 5 widgets let the user choose himself which currency to use)

&#10031;it allows the vendor to create the products in the currency of his choice, to see the prices of the products displayed in his dashboard in the currency he has defined  

&#10031;The admin can have his commissions in the currency he has defined

&#10031;We also allow the admin to create products in the vendor's currency, and assign them to his store.

&#10031;It is possible to customize the currency symbol (for example, the US dollar has the same symbol as several currencies in South America. It is possible to customize the symbol to avoid confusion between currencies)

&#10031;Set a specific products price for each given currency (For example, for the same product, you can define one price for the euro and another price for the dollar. The product will have a different value, depending on whether users are connected from the United States or Europe)

&#10031;Round up the converted price to your convenience

&#10031;It is possible to define a rate of fixed conversion between several currencies in order to protect against currency fluctuations

&#10031;During the check-out, thanks to the multitude of payment gateways which are compatible with our plugin, the customer can choose the means of payment which suits him best.
